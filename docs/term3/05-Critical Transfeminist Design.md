Exploring the Intersections of Design, Fiction, and Power: A Journey Towards Critical Practices

In the seminar led by Laura, the class delved into critical practices that blur the boundaries between design, art, research, experimentalism, knowledge transfer, philosophy, and ethics. One of the thought-provoking topics discussed was the role of fiction. How does fiction operate? Can it serve as a critical tool for questioning and shaping our ideas about the future? Fiction, although not real, can have hyper real consequences that impact society. For instance, the concept of boundaries, which are essentially fictions, has real-world consequences such as political, environmental, and social divisions that even lead to violence and loss of life.

To understand the implications of fiction and its consequences, it is essential to acknowledge the colonial backgrounds and systemic racism embedded within our structures. The seminar addressed the history of eugenics, a philosophy that has been used to justify terrible actions under the guise of moral duty. It raised critical questions about who gets to decide what is morally good and who is deemed "undesirable or unnecessary." The class emphasized the need to challenge these oppressive narratives and to understand the power dynamics that constantly fluctuate in society.

Indigenous feminism and radical Indigenous survivance and empowerment were highlighted as important counter-narratives to reproduce the colonial background. Daniela Ortiz's performance on Spanish migrant laws shed light on systemic racism and colonialism that still exist in our structures today. The seminar touched upon the concept of the subaltern, referring to marginalized and displaced social groups in imperial colonies who struggle to have a unified voice due to various divisions imposed upon them.

Biohacking and the exploration of open source hormones were discussed from a queer perspective, raising questions about control, ownership, and autonomy over our own bodies. Mary Maggic's project challenged dominant medical narratives and proposed alternative ways of taking care of our bodies and the environment. It highlighted the importance of considering the impact of hormones on our well-being and the need to question who has the power to control them.

Throughout the seminar, various projects and references were introduced to expand our thinking. Quimera Rosa's experimental wet lab in Barcelona challenged traditional notions of accessibility and provided insights into engaging with diverse communities and perspectives. Lynn Margulis' book "Symbiotic Planet" offered an alternative perspective on evolution, emphasizing symbiotic interdependence rather than a narrative of constant struggle. The Aquaforensics project explored invisible pollutants in water habitats and underscored the importance of addressing privilege, gender roles, and citizenship in our approach to sustainability.

The seminar concluded by emphasizing the concept of design justice, which calls for designers to be accountable and responsible for their work. It encouraged a shift from a solution-oriented perspective to one that centers the voices of those directly impacted by the design process. The principles of design justice aimed to create sustainable, empowering, and non-exploitative outcomes while honoring and uplifting traditional, indigenous, and local knowledge and practices.

In this journey through critical practices, the seminar challenged our thinking on power dynamics, the illusion of purity, and the importance of collective care. It highlighted the need for situated epistemologies and critical reflection on our own privileges and contradictions. By engaging with diverse perspectives, questioning dominant narratives, and reimagining the future, we can foster a more equitable and inclusive society.
