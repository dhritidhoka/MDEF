Session with Guilliem:

A key insight that arose from the session was the understanding that protocols and platforms extend beyond mere engineering artifacts. They are social constructs that facilitate communication and collaboration among individuals. These tools shape our interactions and decision-making processes.

Overall, this session enabled me to perceive technology as a tangible and material reality intricately interwoven with social, political, and environmental concerns. By comprehending the inner workings of digital protocols and platforms and adopting a critical and reflective approach toward technology, we can embark on designing and constructing more sustainable and equitable futures.
Understanding the technologies we use requires a substantial investment of time, energy, and effort. Technology permeates all our interventions, whether they are digital or manual, and every decision we make, consciously or not. Websites, interfaces, drives, and documents are all part of this process. However, it is crucial to remember that "technologies are cultural artifacts." Any sufficiently advanced technology may seem indistinguishable from magic, emphasizing the need to grasp its cultural significance.


Collective intelligence is another area of focus. We transitioned from a simple network to the concept of Web 2.0. Initially, we believed the internet and the web would be distinct from traditional economies, emphasizing open-source collaboration. However, when discussing collective intelligence, we must also consider the platforms and companies that facilitate these technologies.
