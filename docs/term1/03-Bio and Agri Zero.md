# Bio and Agri Zero

EXPERIMENT 1- MICRO-BIOLOGY

Divided into groups and all having different recipes, we had to create our own  DIY  bacteria . Adding micro-organism from around the environment- I added CHALK POWDER in my dish and after one day, there were bacterial colonies visible around the corners.

EXPERIMENT 2- MICROSCOPY

3 different microscopes- the microscope, the digital microscope and the microscope lens which could be attached on the mobile phone- were introduced to us and we had the chance to look at some of the micro-organism samples that were bought to class.

EXPERIMENT 3- BIO-PLASTIC

We created our own bio plastic using distilled water, carbon source, glycerol and acid.

EXPERIMENT 4- CONCENTRATION OF SOLUTIONS

To check the alkaline value of nitrate, we used different waters from the different soils. These were the results for the same.

###NEWS ARTICLE

[News Article](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2344593-vaccines-that-prolong-the-immune-response-may-give-better-protection/)


The article in THE GAURDIAN states that “The vaccines that prolong the immune response may give better protection.” Vaccines that provoke a lengthier immune response might provide long lasting protection against infection, due to the way certain immune cells get selected for long term storage. The vaccine dose spurs the immune cell which is the B cell which produces antibodies against the pathogen. Some of the B cells are stored in the bone marrow as long live plasma cells which provide enduring immunity.

A study by David Tarlinton, Monash University, Melbourne Australia - proves that the vaccine when designed to trigger months long immune response, the immune cells become better at producing specific antibodies and as assumed the body recruits all its plasma cells from a pool of experienced B cells after the vaccination.  

To test the study of David Tarlinton, they had vaccinated a lab mice with standard antigen and noticed that few weeks later the mice had the genetic modification in a way that created a time stamp showing when B cells turned into Plasma cell, proving that the vaccines that prolong the immune response may give better protection.

In the research paper by David Tarlinton, there is a detailed explantion along the schematic diagrams that explain and support that the vaccination dose hen provided for a long period effect, leads to a much better immune system as the body accepts the antigen produced by the B cells and turns them into the plasma cell.
