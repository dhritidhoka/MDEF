##PROTOTYPING
Prototyping is the stage of design thinking and sprints that usually follows after ideation.  Prototyping not only presents a strong visualisation of the design to understand the look and feel of the final design but it also helps to comprehend better ways of designing. Prototype is about validating your concept, not small-scale details. This is helping in gathering valuable insights and move to the next phase. 

##ROLES OF PROTOTYPING

#Role 1: AS AN EXPERIMENTAL COMPONENT
The prototyping process where we use the object itself to experiment itself in trial-and-error method. I have used this method of prototyping as an experimental component in most of my undergrad projects. Using the experimental setup for my designs to asses the functionality and the stability of the design to the useability and dynamics of the design.

#Role 2: AS A MEANS OF ENQUIRY
The prototyping process where the data is collected and used for developing the design. I have not yet used this particular method of prototyping but it has an interesting approach as to how can the data be collected using technology which could lead to the developing of a strong idea or approach.

#Role 3: AS A REASEARCH ARCHETYPE
The prototyping method where the concepts are visualized and brought into place with a lot of creative imagination. In my undergrad course in Interior Designing, I have been using this method a lot, where coming with new concepts and ideas for a space that have not yet been explored or thought about and to develop those.

#Role 4: AS A VEHICLE FOR ENQUIRY
This method of prototyping where we use the prototype as a vehicle for enquiry is a way of documenting and analysing the designs which is further used to develop the idea. I have never used this method of prototyping but using this method would give a new way of approaching my designs based on the research that goes on with it.

I have used the role1 and role3 the most during my undergrad course and since I have recently passed out and donâ€™t have almost any work experience, I would to try and experiment with as many prototyping methods as I could. I believe all of the 4 mentioned above methods would have really different yet interesting approaches to my design idea.
