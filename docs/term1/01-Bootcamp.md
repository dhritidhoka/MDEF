###WHAT'S YOUR FIGHT?

My fight/vision is to promote physical activity and active lifestyles in rural environments, connecting local cultures, environments and sports through a diagnosis studio, a scientific analysis of the sports habits of the population and bringing them into a playful engagement for an active lifestyle.

Finding a right balance in oneâ€™s life is a necessity and not only in terms of personal and work life but also physical and mental states. Maintaining a balanced life is becoming increasingly more important for your personal health and well-being in a fast-paced, modern world.

A balanced lifestyle is how we live and reflects that the different elements of our life are in the right amount and proportion. Adopting a balanced lifestyle is of primordial importance because it has immediate and long-term effects on our health and well-being. Many recent studies clearly show that heart diseases, stroke, cancer, diabetes, and many other chronic diseases may be preventable and even reversible by adopting new perspectives and lifestyles.

Knowing your body, understanding what the body needs and reflecting on them, is what I believe is the best way to lead towards a more fulfilling lifestyle. I have always been interested in track running and have found it to be my escape. Track running is what has helped me get back to myself after being out there in the fast paced, continuously evolving world. An activity that now has become a part of my lifestyle that bridges the gap between my physical and mental health. 

So, my vision is to  create a more comprehensive approach towards physical wellbeing and encouraging sports participation.
