#COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT

###MY REFLECTIONS-
This seminar threw light on how there has been a great shift in the way of designing- from seeing designing as a tool for problem solving to designing becoming the transition tool for the community to develop projects.  We started the Community Engagement workshop week with mapping out the complex eco-systems and understanding the relations between the communities and different stakeholders and their impact on one another. 

###CREATIVE COMMUNITY

ENVISIONING MY INTERVENTION:

Understanding different age groups and their awareness and interest towards their personal physical health, physical activities and lifestyles. My vision is towards creating a framework for sports awareness and sports participation.  Intervention that would me get data on people’s perception on sports and lifestyle habits.

POTENTIAL PARTICIPANTS:

Local school -Children
MDEF classmates
Sports professionals communities
Local communities

CONTEXT:

I was an athlete and would run for state levels back in India but then had to give it up eventually. And now with this opportunity to work on a project that inspires me, I want to re-establish my interest in sports and want to use this to do the same for others. 

CURRENT SITUATION:

There has been a great decline in physical health or in maintaining a healthy lifestyle in the people of rural areas with the current world situations especially in Spain- where due to such urbanization and migration .. there is major depopulation in the rural areas which is creating both health and well -being issues (this phenomenon is now being called Empty Spain).

ENGAGEMENT AND LIMITS:

Engagement with different age groups will be an innovative approach in it. Knowing your community is the first step towards designing for your community. Creating an environment of trust and commitment with them. But even with this bond, there are limitations to bringing in a new approach. The most difficult change to bring in one’s life is changing their lifestyle. Everyone being different and having different approaches towards topics like physical health and fitness and well-being and their own ways of dealing with them.

THEORY OF CHANGE:

Creating awareness about the importance of a good and healthy lifestyle and knowing your own way for maintaining and following it. People lack knowledge on their own body, and even if they do have knowledge but they lack the motivation to change their lifestyle. 

DESIGN CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITES: 

Design challenges would be to take into consideration multiple aspects while trying to develop a comprehend system for creating sports awareness and sports participation. Design opportunities will be the availability of resources out there and using as much of nature to help create communities who are willing to try out new activities; get knowledge on their physical health in a fun and innovative approach.
