# Living With Your Own Ideas

###Reflections: Living With Your Own Ideas

I took a personal challenge to **live without having any human interaction** in any form possible, for a whole of 24hours. We are so use to being around in our surrounding and environment that we donâ€™t acknowledge them. I took this opportunity to experience being present in this world while cousciously disconnecting from everything.

For this challenge, disconnecting from everyone, and to do so I started off with avoiding using public transport and rather using traditional means of transport like walking or bicycling around. To not have a conversation with anyone, I bought my supplies from a self-checkout store or entering my residence building only when the hallways were empty, using staircase to reach to my apartment as lift was being used by others.

Many such small instances where I try to avoid having a human interaction, seemed so difficult to follow through. While starting off with this challenge, I had the impression that it would be very effortless for me but as time passed by, I found myself in a really struggling state. The surroundings and the environment we have, we undermine them so much that just trying to live without it, it made me realize that for our growth and development, we need to have resourceful interactions with what we have around us, we need to connect with people, things in order to survive in this world. We need to be more appreciative and careful for these resources we have.

With this challenge, I realized how using yourself as an instrument, you get to experience the whole process via a first-person perspective where you look at ideas and concepts through your own views and reflect on them. It makes you realize a lot of aspects that would not have been visible through other means of approaches. Personally, involving yourself opens up new ways of exploring or approaching an idea or a concept. Challenging yourself to get out of your comfort zone and trying out new methods of creating observations or collecting data. It creates new opportunities for you to move forward for developing your ideas into a design.
