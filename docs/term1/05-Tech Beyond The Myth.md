# Tech Beyond The Myth

###WEEK1- Dismantling and Exploring 

After being divided into different groups and selecting an appliance per group, the only instruction was to completely dismantle it and study the parts to create a forensic report on it.

Dismantling the coffee machine seemed really interesting – revealing the underlying technology – which is always hidden under and exploring and understanding the functionality of the internal components. This exercise created a new perspective for me of how these everyday objects are created- so complex on the exterior but so simple on the inside.  Figuring out the roles of every component, opened up with several ideas on how these parts could be reused or be given a new purpose completely.

###WEEK2- An Almost Useless Machine

The goal for the second week was to create an almost useless machine using as many parts of the coffee maker as possible. A machine created using - physical computing, fabrication, coding and rapid prototyping knowledge.

We created a soap bubble machine which creates bubbles, before you do!

The idea was to create a complex machine connected to a huge soap water bottle and as you try to open the bottle- to blow bubbles, the machine does it for you.
To reach to this stage, there was a constant back and forth between ideating, exploring and creating. This exercise was a fun way of experimenting with different components and techniques.
