###My Design Space Reflection

From the deck of cards of Atlas of Weak Signals, the cards that took my interests were- RURAL FUTURES, DISMANTLING FILTER BUBBLES and WELFARE STATE 2.0. 

RURAL FUTURES: having a personal interest in the rural areas has drawn me to this card. I believe rurals are a pool for exploration, a place which does run like a city- a programmed system, it has a freedom for exploring new ideas and bringing them into life. With my fight towards encouraging and increasing sports participation and involvement, this card helps me define my future direction- rural futures.

DISMANTLING FILTER BUBBLES: breaking the surface and going deeper into what is it to have a more fulfilled life? There’s always the standard approach to being healthy and happy: eat well, sleep well and work well but what is more important is knowing your body requirements from time to time. Different situations call for different body needs and recognizing them and then acting is the way to go. There are many misconceptions and beliefs that are not the ones that work for every individual. Filtering out your own personal needs and not blindly following the pack- this is what drove me towards this particular card. 

WELFARE STATE 2.0: this card was rather approached in terms of the current world situation especially in Spain. 
Urbanization and migration have been highlighted as the most relevant aspects in recent developments regarding social inequalities in health.The unequal distribution of resources, the rural world Is lacking in terms of access to quality services, facilities and programs.
In many European countries, the level of depopulation has become a serious and urgent problem. In the case of Spain, this phenomenon has been called “EMPTY SPAIN” and entails both health and well being issues for its habitants.

As per Eurostat data for 2021, Spain is in the EU-27 country with the second highest percentage of population that says they do not engage in physical activities.The lack of services and infrastructure in general (the desertification of services), as well as for sport facilities and programs, accentuates these deficiencies.

This statistics data as per 2021, is what leads my entire design space- the lack of facilities and basic services in the rural areas of Spain - leading to major health issues for the locals. While my project is the means to provide them with resources and approaches for sports involvement  to attain the best with the current situations they are in.

With the ongoing scenario where rural spaces are majorly being used by city dwellers to go to practice sports out in nature - the rural participation for the same  remains low. There are many outdoor activities or sports which can be engaged in without having rightful tools or facilities- leading towards a more healthier lifestyle.
