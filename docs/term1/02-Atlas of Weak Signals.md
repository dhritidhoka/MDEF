###My Design Space Reflection

My poster as shown in the BOOTCAMP page says “be who you really are” implementing to keep your true self while moving on with the modern world. Change is impending but losing your values in the amidst is what I feel is my fight towards.  Focusing on my fight, I have come to known that it’s not a single topic fight, many relating aspects also play an important role.
I have always wanted to come up with some projects for the rural and this seems like a great opportunity where I could bring my ideas to live for the people who can make the most productivity of it. Rural settlements are far away from the urban in terms on global connectivity. To bridge this gap and make the rural also a part of the modern world, the open-source education to the locals on the new trends of the global market would be a first step towards the rural futures.
With the help of ideation and design centric research, exploring and prototyping the best strategies to come up with the most viable methods for the production of solar energy using the locally available resources. Using solarpunk as an excuse to develop a portable solar energy generation kit that could be an easy to install and use. This nomadic solar kit would give the locals to make their workspaces a lot more efficient and self-sufficient. This kit would help them to produce their local productions without having to look out electricity or power cut-offs or limitations. 
The main goal is not to just move towards a more sustainable workspace but also to make the local productions of the rural settlements visible and accessible on the global platforms. This brings down to the other aspect of my project which is to help the rurals to have a digital platform to introduce themselves and represent them on the global stage. 
This combination of creating a solar energy generation kit and a digital platform together to make a rural settlement have a step towards familiarizing themselves to the modern world.
My idea is to provide them a source of energy and a digital platform to introduce themselves to the world but their specialty remains their own. Making it a very flexible workflow for them without interfering with their methods of producing yet making them globally accessible.
Thus, making the rural communities have a future where they can mention themselves as **"LOCALLY PRODUCTIVE, GLOBALLY CONNECTED".**
