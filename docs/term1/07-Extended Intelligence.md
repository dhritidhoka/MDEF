#EXTENDED INTELLIGENCE

###My Reflection

 This seminar of Extended Intelligences helped me develop a deeper understanding and insights into different AI’s and the ethics of using them. What is intelligence? What is machine learning? What are Neural networks? Neural nets/ datasets, how to find appropriate datasets? What are the ethics for AI? – conversations on these topics were greatly knowledgeable. 

It can be easy to assume that AI doesn’t impact our everyday lives but in reality, most of us encounter Artificial Intelligence in some way or the other almost every single day. AI and tech are perceived as agents who are capable of learning, thinking and performing a task but can also have their own limitations to it.

With the viewing of multiple projects done by artists and Estampa and trying out sites such as Quickdraw and google colab, finding datasets and using GTP3  –it has been an interesting week for me as I have never been exposed to these topics in such great depth.

For our AI Project, we were looking at an AI Listening Companion- that responds with empathy to the user’s emotions. It seemed like a very straightforward idea initially but as we got deeper into searching for appropriate datasets, I personally felt that there are multiple aspects that need attention and are interlinked to one another. Developing an AI can be very tricky and dangerous if not dealt with proper knowledge.  AI has its own advantages but also has limitations and we as designers should be able to distinguish them. 

Our AI listening companion had multiple roles to play and to act appropriately as per the situation.  It was an interesting approach towards merging these roles and bringing them together as one final output. The presentation and the forensic report of our project is attached below.
