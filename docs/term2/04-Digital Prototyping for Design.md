(ELECTRONICS AND CODING)

After a brief introduction to Arduino and electronics, experimented with Arduino and a buzzer to create some music;

(DESIGN TOOLS- 2D,3D and Parametric design)

Today was an introduction to all basic concepts and then insights into different softwares for 2D modeling, 3D modeling and Parametric modeling.

for today's exercise- I tried building a Parametric structure using grasshoper on Rhino.

(Bi-Dimensional Fabrication)

Today was all about Laser Cutting and Vinyl Cutting. After deep isights into their histories, usages, properties and different projects; we had a demo on these 2 machines in the FabLab.

the exercise for today was to fabricate a small prototype with the lasercutter for pressfit models or to lasercut a mold for bioplastics.

I, being an Interior design student have had some expereince with lasercutting but my outputs have always been relatively simpler, but for this class, I wanted to use lasercutting to create a more complex object.
