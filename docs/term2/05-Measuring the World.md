#Measuring the World

##

This studio was a way to lead towards knowing the importance of data and data collecting. Tools that can help collect data and how the data available online can be a helping hand in many different directions.

This week had a very hands-on approach where we experimented with different methods that played a role of data collection in different situations using different tools. 

##Triggering Curiosity 

How can a space trigger curiosity? How can we measure curiosity?
Many questions like these popped up during the discussion and while trying to use RaspberryPi camera- how can we capture curiosity? Is this an efficient tool for collecting data? 

We had alot of insightful questions which led to a deeper understanding about curiosity in general and its relation with the its variables.
