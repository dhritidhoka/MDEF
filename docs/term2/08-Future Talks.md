AUDREY DESJARDINES
Autobiographical design:

Audrey shared her journey and her encounters between humans and things using methods like research through design and autobiographical design. Her approach to critique and reimagine current visions while indulging herself in the participatory design technique led her to investigate experiences of living in the current.
The project she shared with us was a deep exploration of how to explore any idea through a first person perspective. Living in a van and letting it develop its course with time while allowing her to look at design as a form of enquiry.

LAURA FORLANO
Auto-ethnography:
Laura’s work also revolves around using first person perspective. The work she shrewd with us was a  project she developed regarding diabetes and health care. The community she developed with all the diabetic patients had a great impact on her and showed the power of having a community. Being completely accepting of our own selves and allowing it to be a part of your project had the most impact on me. Her approach towards her special needs and the way of embracing it while helping others with the same conditions by building a community was a very powerful tool of her design research.

Monster aesthetics:
Service and Experience designer who is currently working and focusing on the contradictions of oppression and including them in his design practice. Colonizers and the power they have over the indigenous people and communities - has been one of the topics deeply discussed in our classroom over different scenarios. Studying the years of colonial history of design and looking at forms of oppression to researching possibilities of design for liberation. An introduction to Design and Oppression network was very insightful with design approaches that focus on today’s conflicts.  The idea of participation in design as a way to promote design knowledge.
