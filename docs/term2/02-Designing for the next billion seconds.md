2.Read the introduction to Critical Hope by Dr. Kari Grain


Critical Hope is a book written by Dr. Kari Grain where she introduces the 7 principles for practicing critical hope–because hope isn’t something you have; it’s something you do.

Each person has a unique, ever-changing relationship to hope. Hope alone can be transformational–but in moments of despair, or when you’re up against profound injustice, it isn’t enough on its own. Hope without action is, at best, naive. At its worst, it tricks you into giving up the power and agency you have to change systems that cause suffering.

Dr. Kari Grain,offers 7 principles for practicing critical hope:

Hope is necessary, but hope alone is not enough

Critical hope is not something you have; it’s something you practice.

Critical hope is messy, uncomfortable, and full of contradictions. 

Critical hope is intimately entangled with the body and the land

Critical hope requires bearing witness to social and historical trauma

Critical hope requires interruptions and invitations and anger and grief have a seat at the table

It is rare that one reads a book where the writer is so open and honest. One cannot help but admire the courage with which Dr. Kari Grain has dealt with the adversities she encountered in her life. On a larger scale, Grain shows an acute awareness of the challenging problems facing the world right now and the renewed strength and skills that will be essential to deal with these difficulties now and in the future.

###MY REFLECTIONS:

Designing for the next billion seconds was a very motivating lecture series that not only gave me a chance to believe in hope but also helped me to see the future in a more promising and hopeful perspective.

There were many different approaches that really intrigued me:

Feel-think-walk about everything
WHAT FUTURE DO WE WANT TO REMEMBER A BILLION SECONDS FROM NOW?
And the whole new perspective on the future… 
The future does not exists
Futures are always plural.
Futures are tools.
Futures to be invented.


The concept of Everything manifesto was introduced and helped us to develop imaginative realities about our everyday life and how it could be reimagined one billion seconds from now. Along with the concept of intercitizenship, making us rethink what it means to be a citizen today? 
Designing for systematic changes and not for solutions,Designing beyond borders.


The realization of the interdependence between all and everything is immaculate. Everything is connected or related to one another and a chance in one, changes them all.


The second day, two videos where share which brought in a complete different set of thoughts:

The first video threw light on:
About a parrot Alex and his perspective to the current world- the world through the eyes of a parrot.

Their similarities with humans- sounds connections, the only species to actually understand and to reproduce words based on their understanding.

The current world where the parrots are in danger of extinction and the last words by the parrot, Alex being- I love you, be good.


Where as the second video gave insights on:

Green environment / Green Growth / is green growth possible?

Absolute and relative coupling , global decoupling

Material footprint and GDP relation direct relation

Material economy- Resource use- new technology finds new uses for the resources - leads to more usage of resources

Digital experiences in metaverses and its response/ relation on material use.

This video introduced me to concepts and ideations that I was not aware of and the concept of Green growth has left an impression on me.


The last part of the lecture series where we all headed together to the beach to view and end the series with a beautiful sunset where everyone expressed their gratitude and the positive energy, it was a great positivity.
The lecture series intrigued a lot of hope and positivity not just for myself but also for the future.
