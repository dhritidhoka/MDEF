Change is impending but losing your values in the amidst, is my fight towards. Focusing on my fight, I have come to known that it\u2019s not a single topic fight, many relating aspects also play an important role. I have always wanted to come up with some projects for the rural and this seems like a great opportunity where I could bring my ideas to life for the people who can make the most productivity of it. Rural settlements are far away from the urban in terms on global connectivity. To bridge this gap and make the rural also a part of the modern world, the open-source education to the locals on the new trends of the global market would be a first step towards developing the rural futures. With the help of ideation and design centric research, exploring and prototyping the best strategies to come up with the most viable methods for the production of solar energy using the locally available resources. Using solarpunk as an excuse to develop a portable solar energy generation kit that could be an easy to install and use. This nomadic solar kit would give the locals to make their workspaces a lot more efficient and self-sufficient. This kit would help them to produce their local productions without having to look out for electricity or power cut-offs or any other limitations. The main goal is not to just move towards a more sustainable workspace but also to make the local productions of the rural settlements visible and accessible on the global platforms. This brings down to the other aspect of my project which is to help the rurals to have a digital platform to introduce themselves and represent them on the global stage. This combination of creating a solar energy generation kit and a digital platform together to make a rural settlement have a step towards familiarizing themselves to the modern world. My idea is to provide them a source of energy and a digital platform to introduce themselves to the world but their specialty remains their own. Making it a very flexible workflow for them without interfering with their methods of producing yet making them globally accessible. Thus, making the rural communities have a future where they can introduce themselves as \u201cLOCALLY PRODUCTIVE, GLOBALLY CONNECTED\u201d.","title":"AoWS"},{"location":"term1/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#atlas-of-weak-signals","text":"","title":"Atlas of Weak Signals"},{"location":"term1/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#my-design-space","text":"","title":"My Design Space"},{"location":"term1/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#my-design-space-reflection","text":"My poster as shown in the BOOTCAMP page says \u201cBe who you really are\u201d implementing to keep your true self while moving on with the modern world.

Prototyping not only presents a strong visualisation of the design to understand the look and feel of the final design but it also helps to comprehend better ways of designing. Prototype is about validating your concept, not small-scale details. This is helping in gathering valuable insights and move to the next phase. ROLES OF PROTOTYPING \u00b6 ROLE 1: AS AN EXPERIMENTAL COMPONENT The prototyping process where we use the object itself to experiment itself in trial-and-error method. I have used this method of prototyping as an experimental component in most of my undergrad projects. Using the experimental setup for my designs to asses the functionality and the stability of the design to the useability and dynamics of the design. ROLE 2: AS A MEANS OF ENQUIRY The prototyping process where the data is collected and used for developing the design. I have not yet used this particular method of prototyping but it has an interesting approach as to how can the data be collected using technology which could lead to the developing of a strong idea or approach. ROLE 3: AS A REASEARCH ARCHETYPE The prototyping method where the concepts are visualized and brought into place with a lot of creative imagination. In my undergrad course in Interior Designing, I have been using this method a lot, where coming with new concepts and ideas for a space that have not yet been explored or thought about and to develop those. ROLE 4: AS A VEHICLE FOR ENQUIRY This method of prototyping where we use the prototype as a vehicle for enquiry is a way of documenting and analysing the designs which is further used to develop the idea. I have never used this method of prototyping but using this method would give a new way of approaching my designs based on the research that goes on with it. I have used the role1 and role3 the most during my undergrad course and since I have recently passed out and don\u2019t have almost any work experience, I would to try and experiment with as many prototyping methods as I could. I believe all of the 4 mentioned above methods would have really different yet interesting approaches to my design idea.
