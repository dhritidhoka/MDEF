Finding a right balance in one\u2019s life is a necessity and not only in terms of personal and work life but also physical and mental states. Maintaining a balanced life is becoming increasingly more important for your personal health and well-being in a fast-paced, modern world. A balanced lifestyle is how we live and reflects that the different elements of our life are in the right amount and proportion. Adopting a balanced lifestyle is of primordial importance because it has immediate and long-term effects on our health and well-being. Many recent studies clearly show that heart diseases, stroke, cancer, diabetes, and many other chronic diseases may be preventable and even reversible by adopting new perspectives and lifestyles. Knowing your body, understanding what the body needs and reflecting on them, is what I believe is the best way to lead towards a more fulfilling lifestyle. I have always been interested in track running and have found it to be my escape. Track running is what has helped me get back to myself after being out there in the fast paced, continuously evolving world.

RURAL FUTURES: having a personal interest in the rural areas has drawn me to this card. I believe rurals are a pool for exploration, a place which does run like a city- a programmed system, it has a freedom for exploring new ideas and bringing them into life. With my fight towards encouraging and increasing sports participation and involvement, this card helps me define my future direction- rural futures. DISMANTLING FILTER BUBBLES: breaking the surface and going deeper into what is it to have a more fulfilled life? There\u2019s always the standard approach to being healthy and happy: eat well, sleep well and work well but what is more important is knowing your body requirements from time to time. Different situations call for different body needs and recognizing them and then acting is the way to go. There are many misconceptions and beliefs that are not the ones that work for every individual. Filtering out your own personal needs and not blindly following the pack- this is what drove me towards this particular card. WELFARE STATE 2.0: this card was rather approached in terms of the current world situation especially in Spain. Urbanization and migration have been highlighted as the most relevant aspects in recent developments regarding social inequalities in health.The unequal distribution of resources, the rural world Is lacking in terms of access to quality services, facilities and programs. In many European countries, the level of depopulation has become a serious and urgent problem.

This statistics data as per 2021, is what leads my entire design space- the lack of facilities and basic services in the rural areas of Spain - leading to major health issues for the locals.

With the ongoing scenario where rural spaces are majorly being used by city dwellers to go to practice sports out in nature - the rural participation for the same remains low.

I took this opportunity to experience being present in this world while cousciously disconnecting from everything. For this challenge, disconnecting from everyone, and to do so I started off with avoiding using public transport and rather using traditional means of transport like walking or bicycling around. To not have a conversation with anyone, I bought my supplies from a self-checkout store or entering my residence building only when the hallways were empty, using staircase to reach to my apartment as lift was being used by others. Many such small instances where I try to avoid having a human interaction, seemed so difficult to follow through. While starting off with this challenge, I had the impression that it would be very effortless for me but as time passed by, I found myself in a really struggling state. The surroundings and the environment we have, we undermine them so much that just trying to live without it, it made me realize that for our growth and development, we need to have resourceful interactions with what we have around us, we need to connect with people, things in order to survive in this world. We need to be more appreciative and careful for these resources we have. With this challenge, I realized how using yourself as an instrument, you get to experience the whole process via a first-person perspective where you look at ideas and concepts through your own views and reflect on them.

CURRENT SITUATION: There has been a great decline in physical health or in maintaining a healthy lifestyle in the people of rural areas with the current world situations especially in Spain- where due to such urbanization and migration .. there is major depopulation in the rural areas which is creating both health and well -being issues (this phenomenon is now being called Empty Spain). ENGAGEMENT AND LIMITS: Engagement with different age groups will be an innovative approach in it. Knowing your community is the first step towards designing for your community. Creating an environment of trust and commitment with them. But even with this bond, there are limitations to bringing in a new approach. The most difficult change to bring in one\u2019s life is changing their lifestyle. Everyone being different and having different approaches towards topics like physical health and fitness and well-being and their own ways of dealing with them. THEORY OF CHANGE: Creating awareness about the importance of a good and healthy lifestyle and knowing your own way for maintaining and following it. People lack knowledge on their own body, and even if they do have knowledge but they lack the motivation to change their lifestyle.

Prototyping not only presents a strong visualisation of the design to understand the look and feel of the final design but it also helps to comprehend better ways of designing. Prototype is about validating your concept, not small-scale details. This is helping in gathering valuable insights and move to the next phase. ROLES OF PROTOTYPING \u00b6 ROLE 1: AS AN EXPERIMENTAL COMPONENT The prototyping process where we use the object itself to experiment itself in trial-and-error method. I have used this method of prototyping as an experimental component in most of my undergrad projects. Using the experimental setup for my designs to asses the functionality and the stability of the design to the useability and dynamics of the design. ROLE 2: AS A MEANS OF ENQUIRY The prototyping process where the data is collected and used for developing the design. I have not yet used this particular method of prototyping but it has an interesting approach as to how can the data be collected using technology which could lead to the developing of a strong idea or approach. ROLE 3: AS A REASEARCH ARCHETYPE The prototyping method where the concepts are visualized and brought into place with a lot of creative imagination. In my undergrad course in Interior Designing, I have been using this method a lot, where coming with new concepts and ideas for a space that have not yet been explored or thought about and to develop those. ROLE 4: AS A VEHICLE FOR ENQUIRY This method of prototyping where we use the prototype as a vehicle for enquiry is a way of documenting and analysing the designs which is further used to develop the idea. I have never used this method of prototyping but using this method would give a new way of approaching my designs based on the research that goes on with it. I have used the role1 and role3 the most during my undergrad course and since I have recently passed out and don\u2019t have almost any work experience, I would to try and experiment with as many prototyping methods as I could. I believe all of the 4 mentioned above methods would have really different yet interesting approaches to my design idea.
