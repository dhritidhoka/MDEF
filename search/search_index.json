The vaccine dose spurs the immune cell which is the B cell which produces antibodies against the pathogen. Some of the B cells are stored in the bone marrow as long live plasma cells which provide enduring immunity. A study by David Tarlinton, Monash University, Melbourne Australia - proves that the vaccine when designed to trigger months long immune response, the immune cells become better at producing specific antibodies and as assumed the body recruits all its plasma cells from a pool of experienced B cells after the vaccination. To test the study of David Tarlinton, they had vaccinated a lab mice with standard antigen and noticed that few weeks later the mice had the genetic modification in a way that created a time stamp showing when B cells turned into Plasma cell, proving that the vaccines that prolong the immune response may give better protection. In the research paper by David Tarlinton, there is a detailed explantion along the schematic diagrams that explain and support that the vaccination dose hen provided for a long period effect, leads to a much better immune system as the body accepts the antigen produced by the B cells and turns them into the plasma cell.

We are so use to being around in our surrounding and environment that we don\u2019t acknowledge them. I took this opportunity to experience being present in this world while cousciously disconnecting from everything. For this challenge, disconnecting from everyone, and to do so I started off with avoiding using public transport and rather using traditional means of transport like walking or bicycling around. To not have a conversation with anyone, I bought my supplies from a self-checkout store or entering my residence building only when the hallways were empty, using staircase to reach to my apartment as lift was being used by others. Many such small instances where I try to avoid having a human interaction, seemed so difficult to follow through. While starting off with this challenge, I had the impression that it would be very effortless for me but as time passed by, I found myself in a really struggling state. The surroundings and the environment we have, we undermine them so much that just trying to live without it, it made me realize that for our growth and development, we need to have resourceful interactions with what we have around us, we need to connect with people, things in order to survive in this world. We need to be more appreciative and careful for these resources we have. With this challenge, I realized how using yourself as an instrument, you get to experience the whole process via a first-person perspective where you look at ideas and concepts through your own views and reflect on them. It makes you realize a lot of aspects that would not have been visible through other means of approaches.

Prototyping not only presents a strong visualisation of the design to understand the look and feel of the final design but it also helps to comprehend better ways of designing. Prototype is about validating your concept, not small-scale details. This is helping in gathering valuable insights and move to the next phase. ROLES OF PROTOTYPING \u00b6 ROLE 1: AS AN EXPERIMENTAL COMPONENT The prototyping process where we use the object itself to experiment itself in trial-and-error method. I have used this method of prototyping as an experimental component in most of my undergrad projects. Using the experimental setup for my designs to asses the functionality and the stability of the design to the useability and dynamics of the design. ROLE 2: AS A MEANS OF ENQUIRY The prototyping process where the data is collected and used for developing the design. I have not yet used this particular method of prototyping but it has an interesting approach as to how can the data be collected using technology which could lead to the developing of a strong idea or approach. ROLE 3: AS A REASEARCH ARCHETYPE The prototyping method where the concepts are visualized and brought into place with a lot of creative imagination. In my undergrad course in Interior Designing, I have been using this method a lot, where coming with new concepts and ideas for a space that have not yet been explored or thought about and to develop those. ROLE 4: AS A VEHICLE FOR ENQUIRY This method of prototyping where we use the prototype as a vehicle for enquiry is a way of documenting and analysing the designs which is further used to develop the idea. I have never used this method of prototyping but using this method would give a new way of approaching my designs based on the research that goes on with it. I have used the role1 and role3 the most during my undergrad course and since I have recently passed out and don\u2019t have almost any work experience, I would to try and experiment with as many prototyping methods as I could.
