Finding a right balance in one\u2019s life is a necessity and not only in terms of personal and work life but also physical and mental states. Maintaining a balanced life is becoming increasingly more important for your personal health and well-being in a fast-paced, modern world. A balanced lifestyle is how we live and reflects that the different elements of our life are in the right amount and proportion. Adopting a balanced lifestyle is of primordial importance because it has immediate and long-term effects on our health and well-being. Many recent studies clearly show that heart diseases, stroke, cancer, diabetes, and many other chronic diseases may be preventable and even reversible by adopting new perspectives and lifestyles. Knowing your body, understanding what the body needs and reflecting on them, is what I believe is the best way to lead towards a more fulfilling lifestyle. I have always been interested in track running and have found it to be my escape. Track running is what has helped me get back to myself after being out there in the fast paced, continuously evolving world.

RURAL FUTURES: having a personal interest in the rural areas has drawn me to this card. I believe rurals are a pool for exploration, a place which does run like a city- a programmed system, it has a freedom for exploring new ideas and bringing them into life.

DISMANTLING FILTER BUBBLES: breaking the surface and going deeper into what is it to have a more fulfilled life? There\u2019s always the standard approach to being healthy and happy: eat well, sleep well and work well but what is more important is knowing your body requirements from time to time. Different situations call for different body needs and recognizing them and then acting is the way to go. There are many misconceptions and beliefs that are not the ones that work for every individual. Filtering out your own personal needs and not blindly following the pack- this is what drove me towards this particular card. WELFARE STATE 2.0: this card was rather approached in terms of the current world situation especially in Spain. Urbanization and migration have been highlighted as the most relevant aspects in recent developments regarding social inequalities in health.The unequal distribution of resources, the rural world Is lacking in terms of access to quality services, facilities and programs. In many European countries, the level of depopulation has become a serious and urgent problem.

I took this opportunity to experience being present in this world while cousciously disconnecting from everything. For this challenge, disconnecting from everyone, and to do so I started off with avoiding using public transport and rather using traditional means of transport like walking or bicycling around. To not have a conversation with anyone, I bought my supplies from a self-checkout store or entering my residence building only when the hallways were empty, using staircase to reach to my apartment as lift was being used by others. Many such small instances where I try to avoid having a human interaction, seemed so difficult to follow through. While starting off with this challenge, I had the impression that it would be very effortless for me but as time passed by, I found myself in a really struggling state. The surroundings and the environment we have, we undermine them so much that just trying to live without it, it made me realize that for our growth and development, we need to have resourceful interactions with what we have around us, we need to connect with people, things in order to survive in this world. We need to be more appreciative and careful for these resources we have. With this challenge, I realized how using yourself as an instrument, you get to experience the whole process via a first-person perspective where you look at ideas and concepts through your own views and reflect on them.

CURRENT SITUATION: There has been a great decline in physical health or in maintaining a healthy lifestyle in the people of rural areas with the current world situations especially in Spain- where due to such urbanization and migration .. there is major depopulation in the rural areas which is creating both health and well -being issues (this phenomenon is now being called Empty Spain). ENGAGEMENT AND LIMITS: Engagement with different age groups will be an innovative approach in it. Knowing your community is the first step towards designing for your community. Creating an environment of trust and commitment with them. But even with this bond, there are limitations to bringing in a new approach. The most difficult change to bring in one\u2019s life is changing their lifestyle. Everyone being different and having different approaches towards topics like physical health and fitness and well-being and their own ways of dealing with them.

Prototyping not only presents a strong visualisation of the design to understand the look and feel of the final design but it also helps to comprehend better ways of designing. Prototype is about validating your concept, not small-scale details. This is helping in gathering valuable insights and move to the next phase. ROLES OF PROTOTYPING \u00b6 ROLE 1: AS AN EXPERIMENTAL COMPONENT The prototyping process where we use the object itself to experiment itself in trial-and-error method. I have used this method of prototyping as an experimental component in most of my undergrad projects. Using the experimental setup for my designs to asses the functionality and the stability of the design to the useability and dynamics of the design. ROLE 2: AS A MEANS OF ENQUIRY The prototyping process where the data is collected and used for developing the design. I have not yet used this particular method of prototyping but it has an interesting approach as to how can the data be collected using technology which could lead to the developing of a strong idea or approach. ROLE 3: AS A REASEARCH ARCHETYPE The prototyping method where the concepts are visualized and brought into place with a lot of creative imagination. In my undergrad course in Interior Designing, I have been using this method a lot, where coming with new concepts and ideas for a space that have not yet been explored or thought about and to develop those. ROLE 4: AS A VEHICLE FOR ENQUIRY This method of prototyping where we use the prototype as a vehicle for enquiry is a way of documenting and analysing the designs which is further used to develop the idea. I have never used this method of prototyping but using this method would give a new way of approaching my designs based on the research that goes on with it. I have used the role1 and role3 the most during my undergrad course and since I have recently passed out and don\u2019t have almost any work experience, I would to try and experiment with as many prototyping methods as I could. I believe all of the 4 mentioned above methods would have really different yet interesting approaches to my design idea.

In term I, my design space focused on promoting physical activity and active lifestyles in rural environments, connecting local cultures, environments and sports through a diagnosis studio, a scientific analysis of the sports habits of the population and bringing them into a playful engagement for an active lifestyle. I connected with the local running club in Barcelona to understand the current situation of their sport while also being in touch with professionals in the health and fitness regimen. I, along with two of my classmates, did an intervention with the locals of Barcelona to discuss healthy lifestyle and regenerative habits. My goal for sem I was to understand and identify the body requirements for a healthy lifestyle and the take of people\u2019s perspective on sports participation in Spain through the discussions with locals and with the help of data collected by the government. I realized that the method I have been working on where I was just collecting data rather than involving myself personally, left me behind and still lost, and realized that the idea was abstract and needed more clear direction. With the start of trimester II, I have narrowed down my idea and mapped out a clear direction for my project while also leaving space to allow flexibility for iterations and growth. The aim of this project is to develop a technology for sports that helps athletes in improving their performance through a personal training assistance. My goal for this term is to create more conscious solutions that lead my project towards reaching my desired aim. With the growing popularity and the incredible properties and usability of technology, there are huge aspects of technology which have already been introduced into the sports world. In sports, there is today a great and growing need to be able to apply various technical aids from different monitoring support for training development to material development. Different outcomes call for different methods. One of the profound methods to gain health or performance insights which is helpful for improving techniques and can also act as a tool for recording body functioning are smart devices/smart wear or smart textiles. An upcoming approach towards sport training is also via AI and machine learning which makes it a more approachable medium to engage participants in sports through interactive aids. Smart sport training centers, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and Mixed Realities are also some of the new cutting edge technologies in sports. With this, the new goal for me this trimester is to develop a deeper understanding and create a connection with the ideologies of sensors and machine learning into a playful and more personalized approach towards sports performance and engagement. To complete the whole process of having an input, a process and outcome, I have to start with collecting data for my input which would be through understanding the body dynamics or the physical exertion required by the body to perform the sport in optimum capacity. To find the appropriate datasets which would help me get more meaningful outcomes alongside experimenting with sensors to collect personal data of the runners community and of myself. The next phase for this aspect for my project development is to have the AI analyze the data through statistical analysis and machine learning leading to data visualization which would provide solutions or techniques to improve the performance. Another aspect that I would like to dive in is smart textiles. Intelligent electronic textile systems that are able to sense physiological parameters close to the human body and respond to changes in the environment which can have many beneficial outcomes in the world of sports. The first intervention for this term is to develop and track the body aspects that play an important role while performing the sport (running)by the local athletes such as heart rate, breathing, body temperature, distance and stride via sensors.

WEEK 2: \u00b6 08.03.2023: (Bi-Dimensional Fabrication) Today was all about Laser Cutting and Vinyl Cutting. After deep isights into their histories, usages, properties and different projects; we had a demo on these 2 machines in the FabLab. the exercise for today was to fabricate a small prototype with the lasercutter for pressfit models or to lasercut a mold for bioplastics. I, being an Interior design student have had some expereince with lasercutting but my outputs have always been relatively simpler, but for this class, I wanted to use lasercutting to create a more complex object. 09.03.2023: (INPUTS and OUTPUTS) It was a very informative session relating to electronics, sensors, understanding the functioning of pullupd and pulldowns, inputs and outputs. The assignment for today was to use LDR(Light Dependent Resistor) and Actuating Light and to test the morse code. testing Morse Code WEEK3 (microchallenge1): \u00b6 MICROCHALLENGE 1: Project: Antonio and I, paired up for this micro challenge week with our own interests in mental health, wellness and physical health respectively. Understanding your body and it\u2019s responses is what drives both of our projects and taking forward this idea, we built a first model that would help us not only collect data from our bodies but also understand and reflect on them. Bio Sensing -HRV( Heart Rate Variability) is where the amount of time between your heartbeats fluctuates slightly. These variations are very small, adding or subtracting a fraction of a second between beats. It changes every second depending on what you\u2019re doing, how you\u2019re feeling. Using HRV to read you\u2019re body and understand it\u2019s state and presenting it in a visual form- was the main concept for our micro challenge week. We created a device that when connected to a person, reads the HRV via the ECG sensors and translates that information into different color based on the Aura color chart that highlights every color with a respective energy and being displayed on the sculpture which when seen from different angles, represents the orb shape. Repo link for our project My Contribution towards this project: After a deep research and exploring the idea of using HRV, we started working on the project together on every step as both of us had interest in all the aspects of developing this project, but with the time limitation, we divided the work. I worked on the design aspect of the project - from creating multiple designs on Rhino, rastering it using lasercut machine, re-iterating them constantly. After many designs prototypes, when we both agreed on the best design, I started building it but faced multiple challenges- from having to change the design, the design sizes because it would it take a very long time to be cut and then waiting for my turn to use the lasercut machine and then the machine not working in my favor. The base structure was another aspect that we both worked on together. We had to create a wooden base and a bio material base using pine resin and coffee grounds. The documentation of the process was something we both contributed towards along with creating a repository for the same. My learnings: This micro challenge week had me on my toes, I learned alot during this week and made me realized how much I have learned here- from coding to designing to managing and developing the project all at once. This week had me dig deeper into electronics and coding to which I had not had much of experience and let me reconnect with my designing skills. The project idea seemed really straightforward initially but as we started building it, we encountered alot of challenges and pauses we didn\u2019t anticipate but helped us learn more. It was a great week for me, I learned alot from the FabLab and working with Antonio on an idea to which we both believe in, made it even more worthwhile. We both would like to continue building the project further and make it not only useful for us in our projects but also the people, making them aware of their body\u2019s responses. DAILY REFLECTIONS: 14.02.2023(Tuesday): The first day was just about forming and group and working together on the ideas and planning the project and its stages. Antonio and I grouped up and spent the entire day sharing ideas and exploring different project possibilities and planning the project phases. 15.02.2023 (Wednesday): We started the day with finalizing the idea and working on the concept and developing the first design prototype while also looking into the electronics and coding aspects of the project. By the end of the day, we had a first design prototype ready and had already starting figuring out the sensors. 16.02.2023 (Thursday): The agenda for today was to have the entire final outcome ready so as to spend the next day just on the repo. But it didn\u2019t go as planned. I spent alot of time making the final design while Antonio was focused completely on the electronics part. Even after having the design ready, we didn\u2019t get a chance to use the laser cut machine until the last hour and when we did, the machine was not responding and was getting disconnected constantly. While we were also struggling with the sensors- it worked the first time perfectly but not anytime after that. By the end of the day, we didn\u2019t have any design ready and printed, the base structure was not ready and neither was the electronics of it sorted. 17.02.2023 (Friday): The first thing I started working on was getting the design cut using the lasercut machine and as that was being done, I started working on making the base structure while Antonio was completely focused on resolving the electronics part. By the beginning of the final presentation, we had the model ready and working. It was a very stressful day knowing that we didn\u2019t have anything in the beginning of the day but by the afternoon we had everything as we planned. WEEK4: \u00b6 22.02.2023: (NETWORKING) today was a very imformative sesiion for me, we touched based with several important topics like- -Networking for data/information flow -What are network and why is it important or needed -Protocols and networks -Protocol for communication -Wired communication/ serial communication and lastly we spent an hour or so trying connect to each others laptop via a MQTT server connected through our ESP32 wifi and try sending messages across. 23.02.2023: (3D FABRICATION and SCANNING) From starting with in depth 3D printing- history to its evolution and technologies, we then also looked into 3D scanning and its history, tech and amazing exmaples. The assignment for today was to 3D scan an object and then then 3D print it or the other way around. I chose the other way around, where i 3D printed and then 3D scanned it. By doing this way, I also got a chance to use the 3D modelling softwares again. I created a twisted column with bricks on Rhino and then 3D printed it and then scanned it to have it back as a mesh model. WEEK5: \u00b6 01.03.2023: (INTERFACES-Machine vs Machine) Interfaces- machine vs machine was a very interactive and hands on session where we strated with a simple blink and increasing the complexity with every step leading until having LED controlled with sensors using MQTT broker. the documentation for the same is as below: INTERFACES 02.03.2023: (CNC-Computer Numerical Control) A very detailed and informative session about CNC and how to use the CNC machine, how to create a file for the same. Assignment was to create a file for CNC and get it developed, and for this assignment, I used it for developing a wooden base structure which we would be needing for the upcoming Microchallenge in the next week. I modelled the design I wanted and with the help of Edu - i created the file for CNC and then with the help of Adai, used the CNC machine to have my object ready. WEEK6 (microchallenge2): \u00b6 MICROCHALLENGE 2: Project: For the second Microchallenge, Antonio and I continued with the idea of bio-sensing and further developing our first prototype which we made during the microchallege I. Bio Sensing -HRV( Heart Rate Variability) is where the amount of time between your heartbeats fluctuates slightly. These variations are very small, adding or subtracting a fraction of a second between beats. It changes every second depending on what you\u2019re doing, how you\u2019re feeling. We created a device that when connected to a person, reads the HRV via the ECG sensors and translates that information into different colors based on the Aura color chart that highlights every color with a respective energy and being displayed on the sculpture which when seen from different angles, represents the orb shape. Our aim for this challenge week was to develop this in a more portable way and to have easy accessibility to the user by connecting it to an online network as well as having a physical outcome. Using this as an excuse to plant the seed of interest amongst the people about HRV and its importance. My contributions: Just as the previous challenge week, I focused on developing the physical output- the sculpture and Antonio focused on the electronics aspect- the sensors and network of the project. By the start of this challenge week, we had learned new fabrication processes and we wanted to implement them in our projects. Dividing the sculpture in 3 parts- the acrylic frames, the support for the frames and the base box for the electronics. For the acrylic frames- we played around alot with new designs and forms ranging from simple to complex sacred geometries but eventually we ended up with the same design that we had earlier used but developing it in a more appealing way and achieving the look we wanted using laser cutting. The next part was the support for the acrylic frames, we designed a support that would direct the light/LED directly on the acrylic frame without having any interference with the adjacent frame. We 3D printed the support. We had to 3D print multiple times as we had trouble with either the tolerance of the material thickness or having the wrong calibrations for the printer, but we successfully managed to have support for the acrylic frames. The last part was the base box for placing the electronics and the 3D printed support with the frames. We used the CNC machine for this part as it was a great tool and with CNC we could achieve alot more aesthetically pleasing yet a minimal design. My learnings: Even though we were taking our previous prototype to the next phase, we still had alot of challenges and difficulties. With my part being to develop the sculpture, I used 3 different fabrication processes- laser cutting, 3D printing and CNC. Having to use these 3 fabrication processes, it was a great way to play around and learn about these methods and dealing with different issues in all three, it did give me insights into different possibilities of applications.

Understanding your body and it\u2019s responses is what drives both of our projects and taking forward this idea, we built a first model that would help us not only collect data from our bodies but also understand and reflect on them. Bio Sensing -HRV( Heart Rate Variability) is where the amount of time between your heartbeats fluctuates slightly. These variations are very small, adding or subtracting a fraction of a second between beats. It changes every second depending on what you\u2019re doing, how you\u2019re feeling. Using HRV to read you\u2019re body and understand it\u2019s state and presenting it in a visual form- was the main concept for our micro challenge week. We created a device that when connected to a person, reads the HRV via the ECG sensors and translates that information into different color based on the Aura color chart that highlights every color with a respective energy and being displayed on the sculpture which when seen from different angles, represents the orb shape. Repo link for our project My Contribution towards this project: After a deep research and exploring the idea of using HRV, we started working on the project together on every step as both of us had interest in all the aspects of developing this project, but with the time limitation, we divided the work. I worked on the design aspect of the project - from creating multiple designs on Rhino, rastering it using lasercut machine, re-iterating them constantly. After many designs prototypes, when we both agreed on the best design, I started building it but faced multiple challenges- from having to change the design, the design sizes because it would it take a very long time to be cut and then waiting for my turn to use the lasercut machine and then the machine not working in my favor. The base structure was another aspect that we both worked on together. We had to create a wooden base and a bio material base using pine resin and coffee grounds. The documentation of the process was something we both contributed towards along with creating a repository for the same. My learnings: This micro challenge week had me on my toes, I learned alot during this week and made me realized how much I have learned here- from coding to designing to managing and developing the project all at once. This week had me dig deeper into electronics and coding to which I had not had much of experience and let me reconnect with my designing skills. The project idea seemed really straightforward initially but as we started building it, we encountered alot of challenges and pauses we didn\u2019t anticipate but helped us learn more. It was a great week for me, I learned alot from the FabLab and working with Antonio on an idea to which we both believe in, made it even more worthwhile. We both would like to continue building the project further and make it not only useful for us in our projects but also the people, making them aware of their body\u2019s responses. DAILY REFLECTIONS: 14.02.2023(Tuesday): The first day was just about forming and group and working together on the ideas and planning the project and its stages. Antonio and I grouped up and spent the entire day sharing ideas and exploring different project possibilities and planning the project phases. 15.02.2023 (Wednesday): We started the day with finalizing the idea and working on the concept and developing the first design prototype while also looking into the electronics and coding aspects of the project. By the end of the day, we had a first design prototype ready and had already starting figuring out the sensors. 16.02.2023 (Thursday): The agenda for today was to have the entire final outcome ready so as to spend the next day just on the repo. But it didn\u2019t go as planned. I spent alot of time making the final design while Antonio was focused completely on the electronics part. Even after having the design ready, we didn\u2019t get a chance to use the laser cut machine until the last hour and when we did, the machine was not responding and was getting disconnected constantly. While we were also struggling with the sensors- it worked the first time perfectly but not anytime after that. By the end of the day, we didn\u2019t have any design ready and printed, the base structure was not ready and neither was the electronics of it sorted. 17.02.2023 (Friday): The first thing I started working on was getting the design cut using the lasercut machine and as that was being done, I started working on making the base structure while Antonio was completely focused on resolving the electronics part. By the beginning of the final presentation, we had the model ready and working. It was a very stressful day knowing that we didn\u2019t have anything in the beginning of the day but by the afternoon we had everything as we planned.","title":"WEEK3 (microchallenge1):"},{"location":"term2/04-Digital%20Prototyping%20for%20Design/#week4","text":"22.02.2023: (NETWORKING) today was a very imformative sesiion for me, we touched based with several important topics like- -Networking for data/information flow -What are network and why is it important or needed -Protocols and networks -Protocol for communication -Wired communication/ serial communication and lastly we spent an hour or so trying connect to each others laptop via a MQTT server connected through our ESP32 wifi and try sending messages across. 23.02.2023: (3D FABRICATION and SCANNING) From starting with in depth 3D printing- history to its evolution and technologies, we then also looked into 3D scanning and its history, tech and amazing exmaples. The assignment for today was to 3D scan an object and then then 3D print it or the other way around. I chose the other way around, where i 3D printed and then 3D scanned it. By doing this way, I also got a chance to use the 3D modelling softwares again. I created a twisted column with bricks on Rhino and then 3D printed it and then scanned it to have it back as a mesh model.","title":"WEEK4:"},{"location":"term2/04-Digital%20Prototyping%20for%20Design/#week5","text":"01.03.2023: (INTERFACES-Machine vs Machine) Interfaces- machine vs machine was a very interactive and hands on session where we strated with a simple blink and increasing the complexity with every step leading until having LED controlled with sensors using MQTT broker. the documentation for the same is as below: INTERFACES 02.03.2023: (CNC-Computer Numerical Control) A very detailed and informative session about CNC and how to use the CNC machine, how to create a file for the same.

Bio Sensing -HRV( Heart Rate Variability) is where the amount of time between your heartbeats fluctuates slightly. These variations are very small, adding or subtracting a fraction of a second between beats. It changes every second depending on what you\u2019re doing, how you\u2019re feeling. We created a device that when connected to a person, reads the HRV via the ECG sensors and translates that information into different colors based on the Aura color chart that highlights every color with a respective energy and being displayed on the sculpture which when seen from different angles, represents the orb shape. Our aim for this challenge week was to develop this in a more portable way and to have easy accessibility to the user by connecting it to an online network as well as having a physical outcome. Using this as an excuse to plant the seed of interest amongst the people about HRV and its importance. My contributions: Just as the previous challenge week, I focused on developing the physical output- the sculpture and Antonio focused on the electronics aspect- the sensors and network of the project. By the start of this challenge week, we had learned new fabrication processes and we wanted to implement them in our projects. Dividing the sculpture in 3 parts- the acrylic frames, the support for the frames and the base box for the electronics. For the acrylic frames- we played around alot with new designs and forms ranging from simple to complex sacred geometries but eventually we ended up with the same design that we had earlier used but developing it in a more appealing way and achieving the look we wanted using laser cutting. The next part was the support for the acrylic frames, we designed a support that would direct the light/LED directly on the acrylic frame without having any interference with the adjacent frame. We 3D printed the support. We had to 3D print multiple times as we had trouble with either the tolerance of the material thickness or having the wrong calibrations for the printer, but we successfully managed to have support for the acrylic frames. The last part was the base box for placing the electronics and the 3D printed support with the frames. We used the CNC machine for this part as it was a great tool and with CNC we could achieve alot more aesthetically pleasing yet a minimal design. My learnings: Even though we were taking our previous prototype to the next phase, we still had alot of challenges and difficulties. With my part being to develop the sculpture, I used 3 different fabrication processes- laser cutting, 3D printing and CNC. Having to use these 3 fabrication processes, it was a great way to play around and learn about these methods and dealing with different issues in all three, it did give me insights into different possibilities of applications. Even though I am not well versed in coding and electronics, I did get great insights in them even just by looking at and trying to understand what Antonio was working on and getting some know-how about it. It was a very challenging week but in the end I did learn alot about different fabrication methods as well as coding and electronics.

Which worlds can we design with the power of today\u2019s tools? How can we design the transition towards these worlds? In today\u2019s world of capitalist societies where a social and economic system in which the means of production, such as land, resources, and businesses, are owned and controlled by private individuals or corporations, rather than by the state or the community as a whole.It is characterized by competition, innovation, and the pursuit of self-interest, but is also criticized for its potential negative effects on inequality, exploitation, and the environment. Design can reconfigure systems of extraction by introducing new ways of thinking about and approaching the design of these systems. Traditional systems of extraction often prioritize efficiency and profit over environmental and social concerns, leading to negative impacts on ecosystems and communities. Through design, it is possible to rethink and redesign systems of extraction to prioritize sustainability, equity, and justice. This can involve incorporating principles of circularity and regenerative design, designing for a closed-loop system that minimizes waste and reduces negative impacts on the environment. Design can also involve engaging with local communities and stakeholders to ensure that their voices and concerns are heard and incorporated into the design process. This can include designing for social equity, ensuring that communities are not unfairly impacted by extraction activities and that benefits are shared fairly. Designers can engage with local residents and community stakeholders in a participatory design process to co-create solutions that are tailored to the needs and aspirations of the community. This can involve facilitating community workshops, conducting surveys, and holding focus groups to gather insights and feedback from local residents. Furthermore, design can enable the development of alternative systems of extraction that prioritize sustainability and social justice. For example, designing systems that harness renewable energy sources or employ more sustainable agricultural practices can reduce the negative impacts of extraction on the environment and communities. Making sense and meaning of design involves understanding the purpose and context of the design, as well as the values and principles that inform it. Understanding the problem or opportunity: Begin by understanding the problem or opportunity that the design is meant to address. This can involve conducting research, engaging with stakeholders, and gathering information about the context and environment in which the design will be implemented. Identify the values and principles: Design is informed by a set of values and principles, which can include sustainability, social justice, user-centeredness, and others. Identify the values and principles that inform the design, and consider how they are reflected in the design process and outcome. Analyze the design: Analyze the design itself, considering its form, function, materials, and aesthetic qualities. Consider how the design embodies the values and principles that inform it, and how it addresses the problem or opportunity it is meant to solve. Interpret the design: Interpret the design by considering its meaning and significance in the broader context. This can involve considering the cultural, historical, and social context of the design, and how it relates to broader issues and trends. Reflect on the design: Reflect on the design by considering its impact and implications. This can involve considering the potential social, environmental, and economic impacts of the design, as well as its potential to promote positive change. Today\u2019s design tools offer a wide range of possibilities for creating and shaping the world we live in. By taking a proactive and strategic approach, we can create positive change in the world and achieve our vision for a better future. Research and analysis: Conduct research and analysis to identify emerging trends and societal shifts that may impact the future. This can involve gathering data on demographic changes, economic forecasts, and technological advancements. Design thinking: Apply design thinking methodologies to identify and solve complex problems. This involves a human-centered approach that focuses on understanding the needs and desires of users, and creating solutions that address their needs. Co-creation: Collaborate with stakeholders, experts, and users to co-create solutions that are tailored to their needs and aspirations. This can involve workshops, focus groups, and other forms of engagement that allow stakeholders to provide input and feedback throughout the design process. Sustainable world: Design tools can be used to create sustainable systems and infrastructure, such as renewable energy technologies, waste reduction systems, and sustainable agriculture practices. Smart world: Design tools can be used to create intelligent and connected systems, such as smart cities, smart homes, and wearable technologies that enable real-time monitoring and analysis of data. Inclusive world: Design tools can be used to create more inclusive and accessible environments, products, and services that meet the needs of diverse populations, including people with disabilities and those from different cultural backgrounds. Creative world: Design tools can be used to foster creativity and artistic expression, such as through digital art, music, and video games. Virtual world: Design tools can be used to create virtual and augmented reality experiences, enabling people to interact with digital environments and objects in new and immersive ways. Collaborative world: Design tools can be used to facilitate collaboration and communication, such as through online collaboration platforms, social networks, and messaging apps. Designing the transition towards these worlds requires a systematic and collaborative approach that involves multiple stakeholders and considers the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of the transition. Here are some steps to consider: Defining the vision: Start by defining a clear and inspiring vision of the world you want to create. This can involve setting goals and targets that align with the values and principles you want to promote, such as sustainability, social justice, and creativity. Identifying the stakeholders: Identify the stakeholders who will be impacted by the transition, including communities, businesses, governments, and civil society organizations. Engage with these stakeholders to understand their needs and concerns and involve them in the design process. Develop a roadmap: Develop a roadmap that outlines the steps needed to achieve the vision, including short-term and long-term goals, timelines, and key milestones. This can involve identifying key initiatives and projects, prioritizing actions, and allocating resources. Prototyping and testing: Prototype and test new systems, processes, and infrastructure to identify opportunities and challenges and to refine the roadmap. This can involve piloting new initiatives, engaging with stakeholders to gather feedback, and adjusting the roadmap as needed. New design practice methods are a stepping stone towards designing for the future and addressing emerging trends and societal shifts. By using these practices, designers can create solutions that are adaptable, sustainable, and responsive to the needs of the future. Human-centered design: Human-centered design is a methodology that focuses on understanding the needs and desires of users, and creating solutions that address their needs.

Her approach to critique and reimagine current visions while indulging herself in the participatory design technique led her to investigate experiences of living in the current. The project she shared with us was a deep exploration of how to explore any idea through a first person perspective. Living in a van and letting it develop its course with time while allowing her to look at design as a form of enquiry. 23/01 LAURA FORLANO Auto-ethnography: Laura\u2019s work also revolves around using first person perspective.

We started with the making process and then moved to knowledge and values and ended up at power. LEARNING SKILLS: This was a great exercise to get us started with understanding the important roles power, knowledge, values and process hold in developing any design or solution while taking into account the stakeholders and other influencing aspects. DYNAMICS: There was an open discussion about fertilizers and with everyone coming from different backgrounds and cultures, there was a lot to be shared and to understand with each other and trying to find similarities and differences between different practices for the same fertilizer and their production processes. INTERACTIONS: The different perspectives and insights into the same practices but in different locations, did influence my perspective. I got a deeper understanding of how and what procedures were followed. REFLECTION TREE: \u00b6 This exercise was a deeper dive into knowing of your personal projects and reflecting on them with the help of the reflection tree and sharing our experiences within a small group of few students. LEARNING SKILLS: This was rather difficult as it really made me reflect on my project and the values I have been considering or not, making me realize the values that I didn\u2019t have in the back of my mind while working on my project. DYNAMICS: After individually scoring ourselves based on the values, we had a discussion amongst ourselves where there was complete positive energy with everyone passionately talking about their projects and about what values we are strongly applying and what values we would like to focus on or improve our projects in those areas as well. INTERACTIONS: There were many ideas and feedback that were shared and it did give me a fresh perspective about my project which would help me see through a new lens and add more value to my project. VALUES: \u00b6 This exercise was a tool that helped reflect on what are the values that lie on the top for us and formed a group with students with similar values and having a tool to express the importance of that value. LEARNING SKILLS: There was a lot of conversation and different views on CURIOSITY and INCLUSION. This was a free space for us to express our thoughts and communicate the idea and the meaning behind it while also recovering a great knowledge of it through different takes on it. DYNAMICS: The group had a really open and free dynamic where everyone expressed their thoughts while having conversations about curiosity and inclusion and sharing a cup of coffee to draw on the huge sheet of paper to express and use it as a fun way to include it in our sheet of words.

It involves considering the values that underpin technology, as well as the impact that technology can have on society. One of the key debates in design ethics is the question of technological neutrality versus technological determinism. Technological neutrality suggests that technology is simply a tool that can be used for good or bad purposes depending on how it is designed and used. Technological determinism, on the other hand, suggests that technology has its own inherent logic and can shape society in ways that are beyond human control. It is important to strike a balance between these two perspectives, as neither extreme is completely accurate. While technology can be designed to be neutral, it is not always possible to predict or control the ways in which it will be used. At the same time, technology does not determine human behavior or society as a whole, but it can shape the ways in which we interact with each other and with the world around us. Designers have a responsibility to consider the impact that their technology will have on society, and to design with intentionality and purpose. This means taking into account the values that underpin technology, and designing for equity, justice, and inclusivity. It also means considering the potential unintended consequences of technology, and working to mitigate these risks. Ultimately, the relationship between technology and society is complex and multifaceted, and requires ongoing critical reflection and ethical consideration. By approaching technology design with a deep understanding of the social and ethical implications of technology, designers can work to create technology that is truly beneficial to society as a whole. Design can indeed be concerned with how things ought to be, and this includes the design of systems and technologies that influence human behavior. Two related concepts in this regard are \u201cnudging\u201d and decision algorithms. Nudging is a concept in behavioral economics that involves using subtle cues or prompts to encourage people to make certain choices or behave in certain ways. For example, the mosquito placed on the urinal it encourages people to aim at it thus reducing the work after of cleaning. Designers can use nudges in the design of interfaces or systems to encourage certain behaviors or choices, while still allowing users to make their own decisions. Decision algorithms, on the other hand, are more complex systems that use data and algorithms to make decisions or recommendations on behalf of users. These algorithms can be designed to take into account a range of factors, such as user preferences, past behavior, and social norms, in order to make personalized recommendations or decisions. Both nudging and decision algorithms have the potential to influence human behavior in significant ways, and designers have a responsibility to consider the ethical implications of these techniques. This includes considering issues such as privacy, transparency, and consent, as well as the potential for unintended consequences or biases in the design of these systems. Ultimately, designers should aim to create systems and technologies that empower users to make informed choices and decisions, rather than seeking to control or manipulate their behavior. This requires a deep understanding of human psychology and behavior, as well as a commitment to ethical and inclusive design practices. Deontology is a branch of ethical theory that is concerned with the moral rules or duties that guide human behavior. In deontological ethics, actions are considered to be right or wrong based on whether they follow certain universal principles or rules, rather than on their consequences or outcomes. In the context of design ethics, deontological ethics can provide a useful framework for thinking about the responsibilities and obligations of designers. By focusing on universal principles or rules, designers can ensure that their work is aligned with ethical values such as respect for human dignity, fairness, and autonomy. For example, a deontological approach to design ethics might require designers to prioritize user privacy and data protection, even if this results in less efficient or profitable design solutions. Similarly, a deontological approach might require designers to consider the social and environmental impact of their products, and to prioritize sustainability and social justice in their design decisions. By adopting a deontological approach to design ethics, designers can move beyond a narrow focus on the bottom line or immediate results, and instead focus on creating products and systems that align with broader ethical principles and values. This can help to ensure that technology is designed and used in a way that is respectful of human rights, promotes social good, and contributes to a more just and sustainable world.","title":"Design Ethics"},{"location":"term3/04-Design%20Ethics/#design-ethics","text":"","title":"Design Ethics"},{"location":"term3/04-Design%20Ethics/#reflections","text":"Design ethics is an important field that considers the ethical implications of technology design and use.
